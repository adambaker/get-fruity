What fruit could be listed below, hidden behind the blanks?

Use your keyboard to spell out the name of the fruit!

Guess the **right** letters, and you'll win!

Guess the **wrong** letters, and they'll get listed at the bottom of the game.

Try to guess the name of the fruit listed before you run out of chances!

You can help with this project by trying it out on your mobile device and telling me if it works for you. So far it seems to work on iOS with Safari, and on Android with Firefox, but not on Android with Chrome. If you can help me make it work on all mobile devices, let me know!

Thanks for playing Get Fruity!
